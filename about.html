                    Having recently graduated from the University of Westminster with a BA (hons) degree in Architecture, I am looking to start a career in the art department within the screen industries, combining my passion for both architecture and film, applying the creative design and technical skills that I have learnt during my course at university. 
                    <br><br>
                    I was born and raised in Brazil where I began my studies in architecture, and later worked in an internship at the Federal Fluminense University in Niteroi, Brazil in collaboration with UN-Habitat. I was part of an interdisciplinary team working on research and urban planning projects for informal settlements in the state of Rio de Janeiro. This experience was particularly rewarding as it gave me an insight into working on projects that could have real-world impact on those communities.
                    <br><br>
                    I later relocated to London, where I continued my studies and was very fortunate to have the opportunity to work in partnership with Imperial College London medical students on a project to design an alternative family therapy room for the NHS. The decisions made during the development of the project were based on working collaboratively with stakeholders and medical practitioners, aiming to incorporate their inputs into the final design to have the greatest impact on future patients. Working with teams of different disciplines rather than only other architects or designers was hugely beneficial for me and I believe I could draw upon this working collaboratively with other departments in a production.
                    <br><br>
                    Towards the end of my third year of university, I also had a work experience at the architecture practice Morris+Company. During this period, I participated in the redevelopment of an assisted living facility in Dagenham and contributed by designing options for the massing arrangement and interior layout of the specialist units for residents with Autism Spectrum Disorder as part of the facility. This involved doing my own research on the specific needs of residents and as a result I was able to produce a variety of design options which I presented to the team for feedback. Being able to not only shadow but participate in the development process in a working practice was a great opportunity which provided me a tangible insight into a real working environment.
                    <br><br>
                    Since finishing my degree, I have completed two online courses: “Introduction to Production Design for Film and Screen” and “Set Design for Film, TV and Commercial: How to produce construction drawings using SketchUp and Layout”, as well as online learning modules provided by ScreenSkills.
                    <br><br>
                    I have working experience of AutoCad, SketchUp, Rhino and various Adobe Creative Suite applications including PhotoShop, InDesign and Illustrator. I bring with me an enthusiastic attitude and a desire to collaborate and work within a team, striving to bring narratives to life and create worlds for audiences to get immersed in.
