                    I am a RIBA Part I Architecture student at the University of Westminster. My interests and areas of study during my course revolve around the social, political and environmental challenges faced today, as well as the narratives that bring a project to life.<br><br>
                    The push to improve biodiversity within urban environments is closely aligned with the theme of my third year dissertation. Centred around the theoretical approaches offered by Donna Haraway and Rosie Braidotti, it explores the relationship between humans and non-humans, and through case studies, it illustrates how architects can respond to these ideas and let go of the idea of human exceptionalism in the context of the current climate crisis.<br><br>
                    My previous experience includes an internship at NEPHU (Centre for Housing and Urban Studies and Projects) at the Federal Fluminense University in Niteroi, Brazil in collaboration with UN-Habitat. I was part of a multidisciplinary team working on research and urban planning projects for low-income communities in the state of Rio de Janeiro. This experience was especially rewarding as it gave me an insight into working on a project that had real-world effects and showed me just how intrinsically linked politics and architecture really are.<br><br>
                    In addition to this, during my degree I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to participate in a workshop in partnership with Imperial College London medical students and tutors on a project to co-design an alternative family therapy room for the NHS. The decisions made during the development of the project were based on working collaboratively with stakeholders and medical practitioners and aimed to incorporate their inputs into the final design to have the greatest benefit. Working with teams of different disciplines rather than other architects or designers was hugely beneficial for me and having this experience has increased my desire to work with a team that places value on diverse collaboration.<br><br>
                    Towards the end of my third year at university, I had a 2-week work experience at Morris+Company. During this period, I participated in the redevelopment of an assisted living facility in Dagenham, London and contributed by designing options for the massing arrangement and interior layout of the specialist units for residents with Autism Spectrum Disorder as part of the facility. This involved working collaboratively with the team and another student, doing our own research on the specific needs of residents and producing a variety of design options which were presented to the whole team at the end of the work placement. Being able to not only observe but participate in the design process in a working practice was a great opportunity which provided me with a valuable insight into the role of the architect in a real life scenario and how it compares to my university experience.<br><br>
                    I have experience using AutoCad, Rhino and various Adobe Creative Suite applications including PhotoShop, InDesign and Illustrator. 
I bring with me an enthusiastic attitude and a desire to collaborate and work within a team that strives to have a beneficial impact on both the environment and our society.
